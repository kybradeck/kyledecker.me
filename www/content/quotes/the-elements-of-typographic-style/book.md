  quote: 'Typography is to literature as musical performance is to composition: an essential act of interpretation, full of endless opportunities for insight or obtuseness.'

    Typography is the craft of endowing
    human language with a durable visual
    form.

  quote: >
    In a badly designed book, the letters
    mill and stand like starving horses in a
    field. In a book designed by rote, they
    sit like stale bread and mutton on the
    page. In a well-made book, where
    designer, compositor and printer have
    all done their jobs, no matter how many
    thousands of lines and pages, the
    letters are alive. They dance in their
    seats. Sometimes they rise and dance in
    the margins and aisles.

  quote: >
    Typography must often draw attention to
    itself before it will be read. Yet in
    order to be read, it must relinquish the
    attention it has drawn.
