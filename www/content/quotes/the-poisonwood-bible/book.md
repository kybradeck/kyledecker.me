  quote: >
    Don’t try to make life a mathematics
    problem with yourself in the center and
    everything coming out equal. When
    you’re good, bad things can still
    happen. And if you’re bad, you can
    still be lucky.

    anything when you’re trying to look
    like the smartest person in the room.
