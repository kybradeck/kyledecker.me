  quote: >
    Poetry is the way we help give name to
    the nameless so it can be thought.
  page: "37"
- 
  quote: >
    For there are no new ideas. There are
    only new ways of making them felt.
  page: "39"
- 
  quote: >
    I have come to believe over and over
    again that what is most important to me
    must be spoken, made verbal and shared,
    even at the risk of having it bruised or
    misunderstood. That the speaking profits
    me, beyond any other effect.

  quote: >
    What are the words you do not yet have?
    What do you need to say? What are the
    tyrannies you swallow day by day and
    attempt to make your own, until you will
    sicken and die of them, still in
    silence?
  page: "41"
- 
  quote: >
    I remind myself all the time now that if
    I were to have been born mute, or had
    maintained an oath of silence my whole
    life long for safety, I would still have
    suffered, and I would still die.

  quote: >
    The erotic is a measure between the
    beginnings of our sense of self and the
    chaos of our strongest feelings. It is
    an internal sense of satisfaction to
    which, once we have experienced it, we
    know we can aspire. For having
    experienced the fullness of this depth
    of feeling and recognizing its power, in
    honor and self-respect we can require no
    less of ourselves.
  page: "54"
- 
  quote: >
    We have been raised to fear the yes
    within ourselves, our deepest cravings.
    But, once recognized, those which do not
    enhance our future lose their power and
    can be altered. The fear of our desires
    keeps them suspect and indiscriminately
    powerful, for to suppress any truth is
    to give it strength beyond endurance.

  quote: >
    In touch with the erotic, I become less
    willing to accept powerlessness, or
    those other supplied states of being
    which are not native to me, such as
    resignation, despair, self-effacement,
    depression, self-denial.

  quote: >
    Without community there is no
    liberation, only the most vulnerable and
    temporary armistice between an
    individual and her oppression. But
    community must not mean a shedding of
    our differences, nor the pathetic
    pretense that these differences do not
    exist.

  quote: "*For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.* They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change."
  page: "112"
- 
  quote: >
    As long as any difference between us
    means one of us must be inferior, then
    the recognition of any difference must
    be fraught with guilt.
  page: "118"
- 
  quote: "I cannot hide my anger to spare you guilt, nor hurt feelings, nor answering anger; for to do so insults and trivializes all our efforts. Guilt is not a response to anger; it a response to one's own actions of lack of action. If it leads to change then it can be useful, since it is then no longer guilt but the beginning of knowledge. Yet all too often, guilt is just another name for impotence, for defensiveness destructive of communication; it becomes a device to protect ignorance and the continuation of things the way they are, the ultimate protection for changelessness."

  quote: >
    There is no such thing as a single-issue
    struggle because we do not live
    single-issue lives.
  page: "138"

  quote: >
    The 60s should teach us how important it
    is not to lie to ourselves. Not to
    believe that revolution is a one-time
    event, or something that happens around
    us rather than inside of us.
  page: "141"

  quote: >
    If our history has taught us anything,
    it is that action for change directed
    only against the external conditions of
    our oppressions is not enough. In order
    to be whole, we must recognize the
    despair oppression plants within each of
    usâ€”that thin persistent voice that
    says our efforts are useless, it will
    never change, so why bother, accept it.
    And we must fight that inserted piece of
    self-destruction that lives and
    flourishes like a poison inside of us,
    unexamined until it makes us turn upon
    ourselves in each other. But we can put
    our finger down upon that loathing
    buried deep within each one of us and
    see who it encourages us to despise, and
    we can lessen its potency by the
    knowledge of our real connectedness,
    arcing across our differences.

  quote: >
    Self-empowerment is the most deeply
    political work there is, and the most
    difficult.

  quote: >
    We must recognize and nurture the
    creative parts of each other without
    always understanding what will be
    created.
