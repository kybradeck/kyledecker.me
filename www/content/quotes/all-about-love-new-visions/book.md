  quote: >
    The heart of justice is truth telling,
    seeing ourselves and the world the way
    it is rather than the way we want it to
    be.

  quote: "When men and women punish each other for truth telling we reinforce the notion that lies are better. To be loving we willingly hear each other's truth, and, most important, we affirm the value of truth telling. Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love."

  quote: >
    Knowing how to be solitary is central to
    the art of loving. When we can be alone,
    we can be with others without using them
    as a means of escape.

  quote: "No doubt it was someone playing the role of leader who conjured up the notion that we 'fall in love,' that we lack choice and decision when choosing a partner because when the chemistry is present, when the click is there, it just happens—it overwhelms—it takes control. [...] If you do not know what you feel, then it is difficult to choose love; it is better to fall. Then you do not have to be responsible for your actions."
